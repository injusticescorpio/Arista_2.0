To avoid health complications that may arise due to low levels of body fat, you need to put on more weight. Make sure you get in touch with your doctor or a dietician for professional insight and advice.",

When you maintain a healthy level of body fat, it means that you have a much lower risk of developing health complications.",

In other words, you have a higher than ideal level of body fats considering your height. In such cases, it is important that you lose some amount of weight in order to improve your health. It is recommended that you talk to a doctor or dietician for professional advice.",

It is far from your ideal BMI and it means that you have way too much body fat in relation to your height, and this can pose serious health risks. It is important that you lose weight for health reasons. Make sure to contact your doctor or dietician for professional advice in such a situation."
